This is Renzo\'s code\.
.P
Debian\'s lintian returns the following warning: acute\-accent\-in\-manual\-page
.P
This manual page uses the \' groff sequence\. Usually, the intent to generate an apostrophe, but that sequence actually renders as a an acute accent\.
.P
For an apostrophe or a single closing quote, use plain \'\. For single opening quote, i\.e\. a straight downward line \' like the one used in shell commands, use \e(aq\.
.SH "Basic code block"
The situation is even worse when there are code blocks, mainly code chunks or commands\. E\.g\., copy\-paste fails\.
.P
Type the following command \fBecho \'Hello World\'\fR\.
.P
\fBbash $ echo \'hello world\'\fR
.P
The following code cannot be compiled: \fBC int main() { 	int example = 42; 	switch (example) { 		case \'a\': return 10; 		default: return 42; 	} }\fR
